# Fin-Lit

FinLit is a comprehensive educational toolkit aimed at promoting financial literacy among users, particularly teens. The platform comprises two main components:

1. **Decision-Making Game:** This engaging game helps teens and students understand the impact of financial decisions and encourages them to make informed choices in different scenarios.

2. **Stock Profile Chatbot:** The stock profile chatbot leverages the Alpha Vantage API to provide users with detailed insights into various stocks. Users can input stock symbols and receive comprehensive company information in return.

This project integrates educational content with gamification, fostering an interactive learning environment. With FinLit, we aim to make financial literacy accessible and enjoyable for users of all ages.

Feel free to customize this README file according to the specific details and requirements of your project.
