# Description
FinLit is a comprehensive educational toolkit aimed at promoting financial literacy among users, particularly teens. Finlit is our attempt at gamification to promote financial knowledge. The novel provides an interactive platform where the player can make different choices at different occasions, which are kept in track through game flags. Ultimately, the final ending - Good or Bad - is a collection of all the smaller choices summed up together. A Bad Ending is not just a result of a single choice but rather a collection of choices which together prove to worsen the character's overall financial situation. At last, we explain over which combination of choices lead to a bad ending and why it is not the best option considering the whole picture. 
The platform comprises two main components:

1. **Decision-Making Game:** This engaging game helps teens and students understand the impact of financial decisions and encourages them to make informed choices in different scenarios.

2. **Stock Profile Chatbot:** The stock profile chatbot leverages the Alpha Vantage API to provide users with detailed insights into various stocks. Users can input stock symbols and receive comprehensive company information in return.

This project integrates educational content with gamification, fostering an interactive learning environment. With FinLit, we aim to make financial literacy accessible and enjoyable for users of all ages.
